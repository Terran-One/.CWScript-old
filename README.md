# CWScript

CWScript is a scripting language for writing smart contracts that run on blockchains such as Terra that use the CosmWasm as an execution layer.

## Features

- familiar syntax: can be learned and used easily without prior knowledge of Rust
- built-in language constructs for contract semantics
- compiles into conventional CosmWasm Rust following best practices
- provides a common framework for communicating contracts with non-developers
- bundled with helpful tooling & generators, and easily extensible
- provides a better framework for composability and code-reusability
