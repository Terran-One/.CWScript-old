# Introduction

## What is CWScript?

CWScript is a domain-specific language (DSL) smart contracts and dApp projects that run on CosmWasm-enabled platforms, such as [Terra](https://terra.money).

While CosmWasm security in mind, contract writers currently. With so much irrelevant unnecessary chatter, contracts become difficult to as these additions scale in complexity. CWScript has a familiar, expressive syntax inspired by Python, JavaScript, and Rust.

CWScript allows developers to quickly think up new ideas for smart contracts and generates CosmWasm code that adheres to best practices.

CosmWasm contracts normally have to be written in Rust, CWScript

## Motivation

While CosmWasm contracts are normally written in Rust, there are currently several challenges which make application development difficult.
